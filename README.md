FrostEdit is an IDE targeted for CoolBasic/FrostBasic -language, 
but it also targets to be a very powerful texteditor in general. 
FrostEdit's development is based on Qt (Qt 5+ to be precise) libs, so 
it targets also to be crossplatform. The editor's code/text editor 
parts uses currently a modified Qate syntax highlighter, originated 
from QtSourceView project.
